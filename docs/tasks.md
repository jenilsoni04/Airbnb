# Airbnb Project Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive list of improvement tasks for the Airbnb project. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Code Quality Improvements

### Naming Conventions and Consistency
1. [ ] Standardize method naming conventions across all service interfaces and implementations (use camelCase consistently)
2. [ ] Fix typos in method names (e.g., `creatennewhotel` → `createNewHotel`)
3. [ ] Ensure consistent parameter naming across controllers and services (e.g., `hotelid` vs `hotelId`)
4. [ ] Standardize spacing around operators, in parameter lists, and in annotations
5. [ ] Fix inconsistent indentation throughout the codebase
6. [ ] Standardize field naming conventions in entity classes (e.g., `baseprice` → `basePrice`)
7. [ ] Ensure consistent table naming strategy for all entities

### Code Structure and Organization
8. [ ] Complete the implementation of incomplete methods (e.g., `gethotelinfobyid` in `HotelServiceimpl`)
9. [ ] Remove commented-out code (e.g., `//void getallhotels()` in `HotelService`)
10. [ ] Fix redundant code in service implementations (e.g., finding hotel but not using it in `updatehotelbyid`)
11. [ ] Implement proper logging with placeholders instead of string concatenation
12. [ ] Add appropriate JavaDoc comments to all classes and methods
